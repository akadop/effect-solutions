# Effect Solutions

This is a field manual for Effect. It is neither exhaustive nor encyclopedic (see the [official docs](https://effect.website) for that). Instead, you will find a set of patterns and "best practices" for writing idiomatic Effect code.

We **highly recommended** that you install the `effect-solutions` CLI, such that your agents can quickly access this guide.

## Quick Start

```bash
bun add -g effect-solutions@latest
```

Then use the CLI:

```bash
# List topics
effect-solutions list

# Show specific topics
effect-solutions show project-setup tsconfig

# Show all topics at once
effect-solutions show --all
```

Without global install, use `bunx effect-solutions@latest <command>`.
