            TASK: Validate documentation ACCURACY against source repositories

            FOCUS: Check if documented instructions are INCORRECT or OUTDATED.
            DO NOT flag missing features - local docs are intentionally simplified.

            INSTRUCTIONS:
            1. Read packages/doc-validator/src/validators.config.ts
            2. For EACH validationTarget in the config array:
               a. Read the local doc at {localDocPath}
               b. Fetch source from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{sourceRepo}/main/{sourcePath}
               c. Compare ONLY what's documented locally against source
            3. If inaccuracies found, create ONE GitHub issue with findings using `gh issue create`

            CHECK FOR (HIGH severity):
            - Installation commands that no longer work or use wrong package names
            - CLI commands with incorrect syntax, wrong flags, or deprecated usage
            - Configuration that's structurally wrong or uses removed options
            - File paths or URLs that changed
            - Instructions that contradict current source behavior

            IGNORE (these are NOT issues):
            - Local docs being shorter/simpler than source
            - Missing features, commands, or options not mentioned locally
            - Lack of comprehensive configuration coverage
            - Source having more detail than local

            ISSUE FORMAT (if inaccuracies found):
            Title: "Documentation Accuracy Issues - [date]"
            Body: Markdown listing ONLY incorrect/outdated information with severity
            Labels: documentation,automated

            If everything documented is accurate, output "✓ All documentation accurate"
